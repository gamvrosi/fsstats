scripts: Used when organizing system trace data, must are about the MSR traces.
         The editedParseTrace is for both generating the disks and idle times. 

rfiles: The ones that remained useful over the semester are kept here. The 
        manually generated cdf scripts all take input from terminal, can be run
        with the lowercase r command.

      /mnt/data/abdi Idle/hotness are stored in folders while the raw data is 
      stored as tarballs.

      blkidles are also stored here, a duplicate containing idle periods for
      blk data smalller regions can also be found on /mnt/data/abdi
